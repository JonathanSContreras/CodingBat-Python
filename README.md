Welcome to my CodingBat Python solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various Python exercises found on [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/python). These exercises cover a range of topics including string manipulation, list operations, recursion, and logic puzzles.

## Repository Structure
The solutions are categorized into different sections as per CodingBat's problem sets:
- `warmup-1/`
- `warmup-2/`
- `string-1/`
- `string-2/`
- `list-2/`
- `logic-1/`
- `logic-2/`

Each folder contains Python scripts with solutions to the respective category's exercises.
